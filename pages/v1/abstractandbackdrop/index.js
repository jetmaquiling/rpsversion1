            The blockchain’s immediate popular cryptocurrency - Bitcoin, opened
            up the massive downpour of interest and waves of cryptocurrencies.
            In 2013, the total market value of the entire cryptocurrency was USD
            1.64 billion. Even then, the greater majority was not really paying
            attention. After 8 years, that value reached USD 2.455 trillion in
            May 2021. That’s a 149,000% jump (1,494x) and can be equivalent as
            the 8th largest economy in the world (Source: CoinGecko). There were
            only 66 cryptos globally in 2013 and has since exponentially
            exploded to over 6k cryptos in 2020 showing a 91x jump (Source:
            Statista 2021). While the top 10% crypto makes up about 88% of the
            total market value of USD2 trillion (Source: Block Social), the
            sheer number of cryptos is a convincing sign that adoption and
            demand from the wider population has and continue to accelerate.

            The NFT (Non-Fungible Token) was brought about by Axie Infinity in

            Axie Infinity has led the NFT-based online game. The attractive
